## ⚙️ Core Workflows (How things work)

To make it simple to understand, here are the **two main journeys** a user can take in this application.

### 1. Free Program Registration Flow (`/free-programmes`)

This flow allows a user to register for a 14-day free yoga challenge. It also tracks where the user came from (Attribution: Google Ads, Facebook Ads) and saves this in the database.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser (React)
    participant GTM (DataLayer)
    participant Backend (Cloud DB)
    
    User->>Browser (React): Enters Name, WhatsApp, Language
    User->>Browser (React): Clicks "Register For Free"
    
    Note over Browser (React): Formats Phone Number (+91 prefix, strips spaces)
    Note over Browser (React): Fetches GCLID, FBCLID, Ad Name from Session Storage
    
    Browser (React)->>Backend (Cloud DB): POST /api/register (Payload + Attribution Data)
    
    alt If Registration is Successful / Already Exists
        Backend (Cloud DB)-->>Browser (React): Returns Registration Status (e.g., success, paid_user)
        Browser (React)->>GTM (DataLayer): Pushes user_data & attribution_data for Tracking
        Browser (React)->>User: Shows Dynamic Success Popup based on status
    else Error
        Backend (Cloud DB)-->>Browser (React): Returns Error
        Browser (React)->>User: Shows Error Alert
    end
```

**Key Highlights in this flow:**
*   **Phone Formatting:** All phone numbers are cleaned (spaces/dashes removed) and prefixed with `+91`.
*   **Tracking:** Whenever someone registers successfully, their info (along with ad tracking parameters like `gclid` and `fbclid`) is pushed to `window.dataLayer`. This helps Marketing run better ads.

### 2. Premium Paid Plan Checkout Flow (`/checkout`)

When a user wants to buy a plan (like a 3-month or 6-month subscription), they go through the Razorpay checkout process.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Selects a Plan] -->|Navigates to| B(PlanCheckout Page)
    B --> C{User enters WhatsApp & Language}
    C --> D[Clicks Checkout]
    D --> E((Razorpay Opens))
    
    E -- Payment Fails --> F[User stays on page]
    E -- Payment Succeeds --> G[Returns Razorpay Payment ID]
    
    G --> H[Open StudentDetailsModal]
    H --> I{User Enters Name, State, City}
    I -->|Submit| J[POST /api/internal/update-student-details]
    J -->|Success| K[Redirect to /thank-you page]
```

**Key Highlights in this flow:**
*   **Razorpay SDK:** We load the Razorpay SDK directly on the page and open a secure payment window without leaving the website.
*   **Two-Step Process:** 
    1. First, we take the payment.
    2. Then, we ask for additional details (City, State) to complete their profile before routing them to the Thank You page.

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

If you want to run this project on your own computer, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables
You need a Razorpay key to test the payments. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
```env
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_test_key_here
```

### 4. Start the Application
Run the local development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080`.

> **💡 Note on APIs**: Notice that we use `/api/register`. Because of the `vite.config.ts` setup, any request made to `/api/*` on your local machine is automatically forwarded (proxied) to the live Healthyday backend server (`https://healthyday-backend-773381060399.asia-south1.run.app`). You do not have to worry about CORS issues!
